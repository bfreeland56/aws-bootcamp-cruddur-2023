# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
For week 0 I have been able to create a Free AWS Account and created a Billing threshold alarm for $50.00 if I exceed that amount.
I have created a Root account with MFA Enable and also a AWS Admin account with MFA enabled and created Secret Key and Access Keys.
Within my AWS admin account I have configured my CLI and Cloudshell and entered my Secret and Access Keys and region that I will work out of.
I have created a free Github with MFA and a free Gitpod account and copied the template that will used in this bootcamp.
I created a LucidChart account, HoneyComb account, Rollbar account and Gitlab account.
For the final task I have created the week 0 Lucidchart Conceptual chart.
